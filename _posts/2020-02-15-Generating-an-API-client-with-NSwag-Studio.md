## Sumary:

If you have to consume an API with many endpoints, a big amount of request parameters, and complex responses, you will save a lot of time by generating the code instead of writing it yourself.

## What is NSwag Studio?

NSwag Studio is a Windows desktop app for generating API client code in C# or TypeScript.
